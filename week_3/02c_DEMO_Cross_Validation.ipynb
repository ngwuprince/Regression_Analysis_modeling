Summary\n","\n","1. We can manually generate folds by using `KFolds`\n","2. We can get a score using `cross_val_predict(X, y, cv=KFoldObject_or_integer)`. \n","   This will produce the out-of-bag prediction for each row.\n","3. When doing hyperparameter selection, we should be optimizing on out-of-bag scores. This means either using `cross_val_predict` in a loop, or ....\n","4. .... use `GridSearchCV`. GridSearchCV takes a model (or pipeline) and a dictionary of parameters to scan over. It finds the hyperparameter set that has the best out-of-sample score on all the parameters, and calls that it's \"best estimator\". It then retrains on all data with the \"best\" hyper-parameters.\n","\n","### Extensions\n","\n","Here are some additional items to keep in mind:\n","* There is a `RandomSearchCV` that tries random combination of model parameters. This can be helpful if you have a prohibitive number of combinations to test them all exhaustively.\n","* KFolds will randomly select rows to be in the training and test folds. There are other methods (such as `StratifiedKFolds` and `GroupKFold`, which are useful when you need more control over how the data is split (e.g. to prevent data leakage). You can create these specialized objects and pass them to the `cv` argument of `GridSearchCV`.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"49e1880e-cdc9-4019-9855-f4c6372f8ef8","metadata":{},"source":["---\n","### Machine Learning Foundation (C) 2020 IBM Corporation\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.8"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
